Inventory Management System is a Project that was made for **(File Structure - Second Year)** in my college. It is a Project for dealing with files to store and retrieve records. I have used the basic concepts of OOP.I have also used data structures such as list, map, vector and set. 

Fields of the records contain Item_Id (primary key), Item_Name, Item_Amount, Price, Type, and Shelf_Number.

For the search function, I used binary search algorithm to retrieve records by the primary key. For the insert function, I ensured that the primary key is unique.
